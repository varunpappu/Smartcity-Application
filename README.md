# Smartcity-Application


The Android application will provide the AQI level of the pollutant concentration (PM2.5) from
every location where the sensors are to be placed. It will also provide the users with the hourly
predicted value of the pollutant concentration (PM2.5) from each location. Also, it will suggest
the users with less polluted vehicle navigation route based on Google driving directions.
